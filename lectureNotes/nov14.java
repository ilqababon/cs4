    // an abstract class is just there to exist as a guide/framework
    // you should not actually be able to create members of that class directly
        // eg: public abstract class Person where Students and Teachers are Persons but you can only
        // make students and teachers
    // methods can also be abstract and have no content -- the subclasses will define the method instead

    // this is done for general organization and to ensure that changes can be easily made
    // as a project becomes more complex
