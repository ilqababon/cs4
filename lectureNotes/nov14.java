    /* 
    Abstraction
        - An abstract class is just there to exist as a guide/framework
        - you should not actually be able to create members of that class directly
            eg: public abstract class Person where Students and Teachers are Persons but you can only
            make students and teachers
        - methods can also be abstract and have no content -- the subclasses will define the method instead

        - this is done for general organization and to ensure that changes can be easily made
        as a project becomes more complex

        Interface
        - allows a class to inherit behaviors, a 'property'
            eg: instead of making a Smart category for all smart devices, they can be under
            their own classes and a Touchscreen interface can be added to each subclass
